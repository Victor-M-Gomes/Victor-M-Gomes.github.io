## List of codes

You can may check my GitHub page to find the open source codes I work on and all other updates on this side.

I am currently a member of the developing team of the GEOS multiphysics simulator, working directly with the wave propagation solver. See the [GEOS project webpage](https://www.geos.dev),as well as the [documentation website](https://geosx-geosx.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html), for more information on this large set of physical solvers focused on tackling carbon capture and storage problems.
