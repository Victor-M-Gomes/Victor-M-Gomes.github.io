## Relevant Information

  * Experience in the field of digital signal processing and multiresolution analysis
  * Base level knowledge with shell scripting in Linux
  * **Programming languages**: MATLAB, FORTRAN, Python, \LaTeX, C++ and shell.
  * **Software Knowledge**: Matlab, OpendTect, Surfer 11, QGIS, Oasis Montaj - Geosoft, HampsonRussell, Seismic Unix, VISTA - Schlumberger

## Education

  * **Master`s project**: Analysis of the Curvelet transform in post-stack seismic data
denoising focusing on conditioning for acoustic inversion. Three methodologies were
compared, the simpler one involving magnitude-wise truncation (hard thresholding) of
coefficients in the Curvelet domain, while the other two considered the spatial context
of neighbor coefficients, by computing their joint probability distribution, in a Bayesian rule for thresholding. Moreover, the last two
assigned a Laplacian prior to the coefficients in each Curvelet sub-band of seismic data.
Besides empirically proving the validity of the prior to seismic data, one of the
methodologies is a novelty and showed good performance for both white and bandlimited
(correlated) noise. **Supervisor: Marco Antonio Cetale Santos**
  * **Bachelor`s final project**: A study of three algorithms of seismic acoustic inversion (seismic trace inversion) and consequently seismic deconvolution and their sensibilities
to wavelets estimated using a couple of seismic wavelet estimation methods. The study
involved implementing algorithms of seismic inversion, deconvolution and seismic
wavelet estimation and then, to analyze the behavior of the first in relation to the
wavelets estimated. **Supervisor: Marco Antonio Cetale Santos**

## Extracurricular activities
